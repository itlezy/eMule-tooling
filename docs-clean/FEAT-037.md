## Summary

Add an explicit release/distribution policy layer for rare or newly published files.

## Release 1.0 Classification

**Deferred Beyond 1.0.** Product decision: PowerShare and adjacent
release-oriented sharing controls are not valuable enough to delay the first
release. eMule BB already has broadband upload-slot control and queue/scoring
work for the 1.0 sharing story; this item stays as a later opt-in feature track.

This feature groups several historically popular mod behaviors under one controlled design:

- `PowerShare`
- release bonus / release-priority queue behavior
- `Share Only The Need` or similar rarity-aware distribution controls
- eMuleAI v1.4 style `Hide Overshares` and default share-permission controls

## Why Add It

This is one of the clearest examples of "beyond stock" eMule behavior that users of older
mods actively valued. Historical MorphXT/Mephisto/Pawcio feature catalogs consistently put
release-focused sharing policy near the center of their differentiation.

For an archival/community-sharing branch, this can be more valuable than another general UI
tweak.

## Intended Mainline Shape

- per-file and/or category-level release sharing mode
- optional PowerShare policy that prioritizes serving a chosen file regardless of normal
  queue dynamics
- optional release bonus or focused upload treatment for selected files
- rarity-aware controls that prefer scarce parts/files over overserved ones
- optional overshare hiding and default share-permission policy
- guardrails so these policies cannot silently starve the rest of the upload ecosystem

## Scope Constraints

- integrate with the current broadband upload controller instead of replacing it
- keep the feature opt-in and explicit
- favor a smaller modernized control surface over porting every legacy mod knob
- coordinate with anti-abuse logic so aggressive release settings do not become a leecher
  fingerprint

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] a file can be marked for release-oriented sharing policy
- [ ] upload queue behavior measurably favors the selected release file(s)
- [ ] scarcity-aware distribution can prefer under-served parts or files
- [ ] normal uploads remain bounded and not permanently starved
- [ ] operators can disable the entire feature globally
