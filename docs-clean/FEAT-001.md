## Summary

`FastKad` is the local bootstrap quality cache in the target. It persists
response-time hints in `nodes.fastkad.dat` and uses recency, health, and
observed latency for bootstrap ranking. It is worth keeping and extending.

**Current weaknesses (AUD_KAD_005):**

- Bootstrap ranking is not diversity-aware — may over-prefer a dense cluster
  of once-good nodes in the same subnet.
- Long-dormant nodes can retain stale positive hints indefinitely.
- No explicit subnet balancing in bootstrap candidate selection.
- No jitter tracking — only approximate response-time spread.
- Quality is global, not segmented by operation type (bootstrap vs hello
  verification vs search).

## Protocol Compatibility

All improvements are **local policy only** — no Kad packet changes.

## Proposed Improvements

1. **Diversity bias** — when ranking bootstrap candidates, apply a per-subnet
   preference limit (e.g. max 1 preferred candidate per `/24`).
2. **Aggressive stale decay** — increase health decay rate for nodes that have
   not responded recently. Cap very old dormant sidecar influence.
3. **Jitter tracking** — add variance/jitter field alongside mean response time
   to avoid over-trusting high-variance nodes.
4. **Operation-type quality bands** — track separate quality estimates for:
   - bootstrap traffic
   - hello verification
   - search-response traffic
5. **Adaptive concurrency** — use adaptive concurrency limits in addition to
   adaptive timeout.

## Files

- `srchybrid/kademlia/utils/FastKad.h` / `FastKad.cpp`
- `srchybrid/kademlia/kademlia/Kademlia.h` / `.cpp` — bootstrap progress state

## Experimental Reference Implementation

**Status in `stale-v0.72a-experimental-clean`:** Core bootstrap-ranking implementation is done. `FastKad.cpp/h` is present in `srchybrid/kademlia/utils/` and includes:
- `CFastKad` class with `NodeKey` (ID + UDP port), `NodeState` (health score, last success, response time), and `SidecarEntry` for persistence
- `TrackNodeResponse`, `TrackNodeReachable`, `TrackNodeFailure` for node health tracking
- `GetBootstrapPriority(ID, port)` — returns a priority score combining health and recency for bootstrap candidate ranking
- `LoadNodesMetadata` / `SaveNodesMetadata` — persistent sidecar in `nodes.fastkad.dat` (binary, magic `KDF1`)
- Response time mean estimated via exponential mean; health clamped to `[-50, +50]` range
- `NodesDatSupport.cpp/h` added for `nodes.dat` refresh/update helpers

**What's NOT done yet (still on the proposed list):**
- Diversity-aware subnet balancing in bootstrap candidate selection
- Operation-type quality bands (bootstrap vs search vs hello)
- Adaptive concurrency limits

**Porting note:** `FastKad.cpp/h` and `NodesDatSupport.cpp/h` are new files — add them to `emule.vcxproj` and include `FastKad.h` in `Kademlia.h`/`.cpp`. The bootstrap call in `Kademlia.cpp` needs a `GetBootstrapPriority`-ordered sort added to the node list preparation. The integration is commit `4798953` in experimental.

## Mainline Progress

Current local `main` is no longer at the pure-proposal stage.

Landed in `main` via commit `125720f` (`FEAT-001: port FastKad and nodes.dat support`):

- `FastKad.cpp/h` and `NodesDatSupport.cpp/h` are now compiled in the app project
- bootstrap contact ranking now consults `GetBootstrapPriority(...)`
- `nodes.fastkad.dat` sidecar persistence is wired through routing-zone load/save
- response/reachability/failure tracking is wired into the live Kad flow
- conservative response-time estimation and health/recency ranking are live

Remaining follow-through keeps this item `In Progress` rather than `Done`:

- explicit diversity-aware subnet balancing inside the FastKad bootstrap ranking policy
- stronger stale-decay follow-through beyond the current recency bucket aging
- any future operation-type quality-band or adaptive-concurrency extensions
